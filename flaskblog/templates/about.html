          Welcome to my blog! My name is <b>Heni</b> (you can call me <b><em>Hanaw</em></b>), and I'm so glad you're here. I created this website as a platform to share my thoughts, experiences, and expertise on topics related to my passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an energy engineer with 10 years of experience and I love programming especially building websites. Throughout my career,
          I've developed a passion for problem-solving by designing and auditing many installation in many industries.
          I believe that by sharing my knowledge and insights with others,
          I can help them navigate the challenges and opportunities in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this blog isn't just about my professional experiences. In my free time,
          I love to build web applications, learning something new about astrophysics, watching my favorite team FC BARCELONA, playing some DOTA.
          I believe that these personal pursuits help to inform and enrich my work, and I hope that they can provide inspiration to my readers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're here to learn something new, gain a fresh perspective, or simply connect with a like-minded individual,
          I hope that you'll find something of value on this blog. Thank you for stopping by!
